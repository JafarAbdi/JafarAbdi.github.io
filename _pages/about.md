I'm a robotics engineer focused on developing AI-powered solutions that make robots more capable and accessible in real-world applications.

Born in the UAE to a Turkish father and Kurdish-Syrian mother, my journey has taken me through five countries, each adding a unique perspective to my worldview. This multicultural background has shaped my approach to problem-solving and collaboration. The ability to navigate diverse environments has been particularly valuable in my work with international teams and open-source communities.

My work spans a range of topics, including robot learning and manipulation, open-source development.
